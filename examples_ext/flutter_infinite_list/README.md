# flutter_infinite_list

This example is a modified version of the [Infinite List Tutorial](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterinfinitelisttutorial) created for the [bloc library](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc).

See usage of the `chunk` package in the [post_bloc](/lib/posts/bloc/post_bloc.dart) and [post_state](/lib/posts/bloc/post_state.dart) files.
